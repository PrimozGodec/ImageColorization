Image and video colorizer
=========================

Image and video colorizer is package for automatic image and video colorization. 
Models are already trained.

## Instalation

Installation can be done in 5 easy steps

1.  Install all requirements for [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) 
and tensorflow itself with:

        pip install tensorflow-gpu
        
     if you use GPU device for computation otherwise:
     
        pip install tensorflow
    
2.  Create virtual environment
    
        virtualenv -p python3 colorization_venv
        
3.  Activate virtual environment

        source colorization_venv/bin/activate
        
4.  Clone **Image and video colorization** package and move in it

        git clone https://github.com/PrimozGodec/ImageColorization.git
        cd ImageColorization
        
5.  Install requirements

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
6.  You are done :)

In case you do not have a GPU device in your computer, please install Tensorflow 
for a CPU. [Instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ "Tensorflow") are at
the [Tnesorflow website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ "Tensorflow").

## Image colorization

For automatic image colorizing follow those steps:

1.  Copy images into `/data/image/original` directory

2.  Run `main.py` script from `src/image_colorization/` directory.

        python -m src.image_colorization.main --model <model name>
     
    Parameter `--method` is optional, if not present `reg_full_model` is default.
    It can be choose from this list:

    * `reg_full_model` (default)
    * `reg_full_vgg_model`
    * `reg_part_model`
    * `class_weights_model`
    * `class_wo_weights_model`

3. You can find colored images in `/data/image/colorized` directory.

 on your GPU or CPU specifications. 
You will see progress bar that show you how far you are with colorization.

## Video colorization

For automatic video colorizing follow those steps:

1.  Copy images into `/data/video/original` directory

2.  Run `video_colorizer.py` script from `src/video_colorization/` directory.

        python -m src.video_colorization.video_colorizer
     
    Video colorizer is always using `reg_full_model`.

3. You can find colored videos in `/data/video/colorized` directory.

Colorization take few hours since there is a lot of images to color in a video
and depends on your GPU or CPU specifications and length of a video. 
You will see progress bar that show you how far you are with colorization.
